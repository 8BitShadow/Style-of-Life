# Style-of-Life
Style Of Life (SOL) is an open source program with the goal of providing excessive choice in 'style of life' - utility - programs, all bundled in one place to make life all the more easier. The program is built with a highly in-depth commenting style with the goal to also have SOL be used as a 'playground' for both new and experienced programmers to come learn, practice, teach and/or participate.

**Currently the installer is not working properly (because the manifests visual stuio generates are being wack), SO DON'T USE IT**.
Instead go into the "SOL (dev files)\SOL\bin\Debug" folder and use the .exe that's there for now.

For developers, the installer creates the executable here:
%AppData%\..\Local\Apps\2.0\Y0KZ27J0.QYW\VDABDBGK.RO3\sol...tion_0000000000000000_0001.0000_42e09a81965087f8
The resources folder it reads from doesn't have all the data in it (for some reason it's stored in some other random folder within the '2.0' folder) once you put it in there, it seems to work fine.
