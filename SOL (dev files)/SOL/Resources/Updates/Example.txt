Feel free to use any of my code here, its all licensed under a GNU licence       
(look at the about pages in the help tabs) so you can even use it
commercially but make sure you reference!

While my code may be open source, others who provide their own
programs may only have it there for educational puporses or otherwise just
avalible without the code being avalible to view or use e.c.t. Make sure
you always check the programs about page, if it doesn't have one then
consider it soley closed source unless clearly specified by the creator
otherwise.

Otherwise this window will be quickly filled and make it hard to find what goes to what.\i
and it wouldn't look good anyway. and be clunky to use otherwise.
