Feel free to use any of my code here, its all licensed under a GNU licence\nbc(210 ,210 ,210)//for example this wont be read
(look at the about pages in the help tabs) so you can even use it\nbc(210,210,210)
commercially but make sure you reference!\nbc(210,210,210)

While my code may be open source, others who provide their own\nbc(210,210,210)
programs may only have it there for educational puporses or otherwise just\nbc(210,210,210)
avalible without the code being avalible to view or use e.c.t. Make sure\nbc(210,210,210)
you always check the programs about page, if it doesn't have one then\nbc(210,210,210)
consider it soley closed source unless clearly specified by the creator\nbc(210,210,210)
otherwise.\nbc(210,210,210)

\bc(253, 230, 230), set the background colour
//
