Notes:
Need to add mass folder renaming
Need to add "text prior"
Need to save user preferences & last chosen directory
Need to change delegation from using text files to arrays (have the threads choose which is their delegation via doing random between 1 and the processorCount)

1.1.3.4\s
Fixed: The program should no longer spam you with error messages if a null claiming occurs
Changed: the claimant process is now much smaller and ready to be replaced by a self contained claimant system (not using text files)
\e

1.1.3.2\s
Fixed a crash when trying to rename a file when the name to rename to already\nbc(210, 210, 210)				//bugfix (minor)
exists as a file (e.g. file1 trying to rename to '1', but the file '1' already exists).\nbc(210, 210, 210)
Added progress bars																								//small content (minor)
Added multi-threading\nbc(210, 210, 210)\i																		//Large content (primary)
Note: Single core computers are no longer supported (although I can't
imagine why someone with *that* would be using a program like this).
\nbc(210, 210, 210)
\e
Fixed alternate root for randomisation to actually randomise.													//bugfix (minor)
Re-added and updated the error logger\nbc(210, 210, 210)\i
Added: Error logger can now queue messages to send to a file in a
multi-processor freindly manner.
Added: Error logger now auto tabs queued messages at a tab ratio of 4 (use\nbc(210, 210, 210)
VS or notepad++ to read em).\nbc(210, 210, 210)
Added many ways to interact with the message queue.
\nbc(210, 210, 210)
\e
Added: The program will now force a crashout during the renaming process if										//small failsafe (minor)
something goes wrong to prevent any potential "damage".
Added: The program will now gracefully fail before the renaming process if\nbc(210, 210, 210)					//failsafe (minor)
something goes wrong.\nbc(210, 210, 210)
Added input sanitisation																						//small content (minor)
\e

1.0.2.6\s
Fixed an issue where the icon would not load as it was searching the wrong directory (was searching statically)
Updated binaries to reflect the correct application & build versions
\e

1.0.2.5\s
Added a warning that there is currently no input sanitisation
Fixed a crash that would occur if the file that's being renamed already exists
Fixed a problem with mass renaming a folder multiple times, resulting in only one file being renamed
Added the Ability to disable renaming, allowing users to be able to use the "add extra text" and "change extention" functions without chaing the selected file's names
Added the ability to change a file extention during renaming
Fixed the "add extra text" box, it's now actually optional like it says
Updated binaries to reflect the correct application & build versions
